I built this python project as a first attempt to practice working with the language and assemble some data that can be worked with in matplotlib. The resulting graphs from this project, while very simplistic, demonstrate the unlikliness of success over the long-term in playing Blackjack regardless of when one may hit, split, or stay.

Feel free to offer suggestions for improvements or other ways to look at playing the game that would improve the chances of success without counting cards.

Thanks!
